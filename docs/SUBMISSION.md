## Proof Links (fill before submit)

### Wallet Creation Proof
- Address: `<WALLET_ADDRESS>`

### Devnet Transaction Proofs
- Memo TX #1: `<EXPLORER_LINK_1>`
- Memo TX #2: `<EXPLORER_LINK_2>`

### Autonomous Agent Proof
- Tick output screenshot: `<SCREENSHOT_LINK>`
- Events feed screenshot: `<SCREENSHOT_LINK>`

## Demo Script (60-90s)
1. Open live frontend
2. Create/fetch wallet
3. Show SOL balance on devnet
4. Trigger memo proof transaction
5. Run one autonomous agent tick
6. Show decision trace and tx evidence

## Security Summary
- Devnet-first defaults
- Dry-run default safety
- Deterministic policy gates
- Override path for escalations
- Clear separation: agent logic vs wallet signer
